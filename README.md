# Grain Analysis Tool

This is a Python application that uses OpenCV to analyze images of grains. It calculates the coefficient of variance for the width and height of the grains, counts the number of grains, and visualizes these measurements on the image.

## How it Works

The application follows these steps:

1. Load the image.
2. Convert the image to grayscale.
3. Apply a binary inverse threshold to the grayscale image.
4. Find contours in the thresholded image.
5. Process the contours:
    - For each contour, if its area is greater than a minimum contour area:
        - Draw a rectangle around the contour on the image.
        - Calculate the width and height of the rectangle in millimeters.
        - Write the width and height on the image.
        - Add the width and height to lists.
        - Increment a count of the grains.
6. Calculate the coefficient of variance for the widths and heights.
7. Write the count of grains and the coefficients of variance on the image.
8. Resize the image.
9. Display the image and save it to an output file.

## Code Structure

The code is organized into several functions:

- `load_image(image_path)`: Loads an image from a file.
- `convert_to_grayscale(image)`: Converts an image to grayscale.
- `apply_threshold(image)`: Applies a binary inverse threshold to an image.
- `find_contours(image)`: Finds contours in an image.
- `calculate_coefficient_of_variance(values)`: Calculates the coefficient of variance of a list of values.
- `process_contours(contours, image, ppmm, min_contour_area)`: Processes contours found in an image.
- `analyze_image(image_path, output_path, ppmm, min_contour_area)`: The main function that uses the above functions to analyze an image.

## Usage

To use this application, run the `worker.py` script. For example:

```bash
python worker.py
```

This will analyze the image `img/beans.jpg` and save the output to `img/beans_output.jpg`.
